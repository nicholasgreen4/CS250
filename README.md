How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  User stories are brief, informal descriptions of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the user. A user story  typically consists of three elements: a user role, a specific goal or objective, and a reason or benefit for achieving that goal. An example of a user story might be "As a customer, I want to be able to create a new account so that I can access exclusive content and receive personalized recommendations."
  Creating user stories helps to keep the focus on the user and their needs throughout the development process by identifying the user's goals and motivations to allow the development team to better understand what features and functionalities are most important to the user. 
  Once user stories have been created, the development team can break down each user story into smaller tasks which must be completed to implement the functionality described in the story, which allows the team to work in small, incremental steps towards completing the user story and delivering the desired functionality.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  When approaching program development, it's important to have a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve, and to keep the user's needs and goals at the forefront of the development process. The key benefit of agile development is that it allows for flexibility and adaptability throughout the development process, allowing the developers to adjust their approach as needed based on feedback from users or changes in requirements. I hope to implement lean development to eliminate waste and increase efficiency in the development process.
